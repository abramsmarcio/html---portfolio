<h1>0123's best movies/anime 2024</h1>
<h2>Interstellar</h2>
<p>I have been wanting to watch this movie for a long time.<br /> It was just a month before that I was able to watch it and I absolutely loved it.<br /> A great sci-fi movie to watch.</p>
<h2>Naruto</h2>
<p>I would not call me as a guy who is into anime so madly.<br /> But I started watching Naruto because my roommate suggested me to watch it, Now I adore this anime.</p>
<h2>Hi Naana</h2>
<p>This is also one my personal favourite movie of 2024.<br /> It was an amazing romantic movie.</p>
